# Summary
ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
[[Diffusion Models]] is a kind of image generative model, by iteratively predict and subtract the noise in the given image (starting from complete noise), diffusion models can usually output decent result, thus SOTA image generation models usually use diffusion based methods.

Using methods like [[Latent Diffusion]] or [[ControlNet]], [[Diffusion Models]] are able to take in text or different modalities of inputs.

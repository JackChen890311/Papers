# Summary
ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
FID is a metric used to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated images in generative models, particularly in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It measures the similarity between two sets of feature vectors extracted from real images and generated images using a pre-trained Inception-v3 model. The feature vectors represent high-level visual features of the images, and the lower the FID score, the more similar the distributions of real and generated images are perceived to be.

# Summary
ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
FVD measures the similarity between two video sequences. It calculates the Frechet distance between feature vectors extracted from the video frames using a pre-trained DNN. The feature vectors capture the visual information in the videos, and the lower the FVD, the more similar the videos are perceived to be.

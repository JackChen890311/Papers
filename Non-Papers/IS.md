IS is a metric designed to assess the quality and diversity of images generated by generative models, particularly in the realm of GANs. It evaluates the generated images based on two key aspects: the quality of individual images and the diversity of the generated dataset.

To calculate the IS, the generative model produces a set of images, and each image is passed through a pre-trained classifier network, typically Inception-v3. The classifier assigns a class probability distribution to each image, indicating how likely it belongs to various predefined categories. The IS is then computed by taking the entropy of the class distributions (diversity) and the average of the maximum class probabilities (quality) across all generated images. 

- Compare with [[FID]], IS can be view as a metric focused more on **diversity**

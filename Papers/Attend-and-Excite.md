# Methodology
ğŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper
They found that stable diffusion will have some failure cases:

And propose a attention based loss term for improvement:
- Identify the most neglected patch of subjects
- Add it to loss (max L => min (max(G(A))) => minimum of maximum of attention maps => most neglected attended patch)

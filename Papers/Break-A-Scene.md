# Summary
ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
Use new identifier to represent each concept, then use it for down stream generation.

# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper
## Input
- Single Image
- Mask of the desired concepts
## Training Strategy
- Two stage training
	- High learning rate for newly-added embedding
	- Low learning rate for both the embedding and the model
- Union Sampling
	- Randomly select a subset of concepts and reconstruct it
- Masked Diffusion Loss
	- Only calculate loss at masked area
	- The masking seems in pixel space, but in implementation they directly downsample the mask to latent space?
	  Kind of strange I think.

- Cross-Attention Loss
	- This loss is needed for avoiding associating two embeddings to a same concept

ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper

# Experiments
ðŸ’¡ List the experiments settings and results of this paper
By controling eta, we can obtain different results.
 - eta = 1 -> [[DDPM]]
 - eta = 0 -> [[DDIM]] (Deterministic, Same input noise will have same output image)

# Summary
ðŸ’¡ Write a brief summary of this paper here
An improved version of [[Diffusion Models]] by using latent vector in [[AutoEncoder]] to do [[DDPM]] process, also widely know as stable diffusion (due to stability.ai)

# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper

- Cross attention method (Q from image latent, KV from conditioning)

	- Summary: Based on the format of conditioning, the switch will switch to different path (image/text/...)

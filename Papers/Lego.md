# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper
[[Textual Inversion]] + Subject Separation + Context Loss
![[Pasted image 20250104152739.png]]
- Subject Separation
  Use </sub/> & </sub/>+ </cpt/> to disentangle subject and concept embedding
- Context Loss
  Use contrastive loss + pre-defined positive & negative word
  Kind of like [[ReVersion]]

The use t-SNE on text embedding space and found that words with same POS will come closer.

# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper
![[Pasted image 20240314231337.png]]
- Add Steering Loss to learn the </R/> ([[InfoNCE]] on POS)

- Also with a Relation-Focal Importance Sampling: 
  A skew sampling method which favors a larger t for better catch high level relationship

# Methodology
ðŸ’¡ Describe the methodology used in this paper
- Contrary to the original Stable Diffusion, which uses text prompts, we pass the processed image condition feature as the input to the cross-attention layers
- Use attention score for information exchange between the image and vector
- Use cross attention loss from [[FastComposer]]

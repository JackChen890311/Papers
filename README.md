# Papers
This repository contains the papers I've read and the notes I've taken during my master.  
**Please be aware that this repository is mainly for personal use.**  

But feel free to look around, maybe you'll gain some new ideas!  
Please see the following two pages as starting points, and use obsidian for best experience.   
- [[Dashboard - Papers]]  
- [[Dashboard - Non-Papers]]  
Template for each paper is at [[Template - Papers]].  
Some of my simple ideas can be found at [[Thoughts]].

Still working on it, feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts!

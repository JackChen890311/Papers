# Papers
This repository contains the papers I've read and the notes I've taken during my master.  
**Please be aware that this repository is mainly for personal use.**  

But feel free to look around, maybe you'll gain some new ideas!  
Please see [[Dashboard - Main]] as a starting point, and use obsidian for best experience.   

Still working on it, feel free to contact me if you have any thoughts!
